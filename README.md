## Projects
[Project0](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS111_Operating_Systems_Principles/tree/master/Project0) contains a warmup project for this course. A description for the project can be found [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs111/labs/project0.html).

[Project1](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS111_Operating_Systems_Principles/tree/master/Project1) contains an implementation for a simpleton shell. A description for the project can be found [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs111/assign/lab1.html).

[Project2A part1](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS111_Operating_Systems_Principles/tree/master/lab2a) contains implementation and analysis for multi-threaded updates to a shared variable. A description for the project can be found [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs111/labs/P2A_lock/ASSIGNMENT/P2A.html).

[Project2A part2](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS111_Operating_Systems_Principles/tree/master/2alist) contains implementation and analysis for multi-threaded updates to a relatively complex data structure(a sorted list here). A description for the project can be found [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs111/labs/P2A_lock/ASSIGNMENT/P2A.html).

[Project2B](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS111_Operating_Systems_Principles/tree/master/lab2b) contains implementation and analysis for mutex and spin-lock as bottlenecks. A description for the project can be found [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs111/labs/P2B_contention/ASSIGNMENT/P2B.html).

[Project 3A](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS111_Operating_Systems_Principles/tree/master/lab3a) contains a simple analyzer for a filesystem which outputs an analysis summary. A description for the project can be found [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs111/labs/P3A_fs/ASSIGNMENT/P3A.html).

[Project 4B](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS111_Operating_Systems_Principles/tree/master/lab4b) contains an application that runs in an embedded system and read data from external sensors. A description for the project can be found [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs111/labs/P4B_sensors/ASSIGNMENT/P4B.html).

[Project 4C part1](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS111_Operating_Systems_Principles/tree/master/lab4c_part1) contains an application that communicates with a TCP logging server. A description for the project can be found [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs111/labs/P4C_iot/ASSIGNMENT/P4C.html).

[Project 4C part2](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS111_Operating_Systems_Principles/tree/master/lab4c_part2) contains an application that communicates with a TLS logging server. A description for the project can be found [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs111/labs/P4C_iot/ASSIGNMENT/P4C.html).
